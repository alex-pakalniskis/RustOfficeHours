**Detailed description of your proposal**

While there is a growing demand for Rust skills across many core developer teams, the pool of skilled Rust engineers remains fairly small. 
Likewise, there are few (if any) existing Rust learning materials with content specific to The Graph.
This project aims to support the development of Rust engineers interested in The Graph protocol by creating free and open source learning content centered on The Graph.

Past and upcoming guide topics include:
* [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)
* [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/)
* [Graphcast](https://docs.graphops.xyz/graphcast/intro)

For existing prototype guides under development, please visit https://alex-pakalniskis.github.io/RustOfficeHoursResources/sessions.html

**Goals & milestones**

10 Rust developer guides of increasing technical difficulty released over Q1 and Q2 2023.
Each guide will have an associated video recording shared on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@alexpakalniskis).

**Projected impact on The Graph**

Guides will support the learning of current and aspiring Rust engineers in our community by covering foundational and intermediate Rust concepts while engaging with domain specific topics relevant to The Graph. Growing the pool of Rust engineers in the community will benefit the long-term health of the protocol by supporting the decentralization of contributions to the core tech stack. Furthermore, this initative supports the on-going labor needs of core ecosystem developers by helping to train the next generation of web3 Rust engineers. 

**Proposed USD funding amount**

$5000

**Detailed description of the how the funds will be spent**

Compensation for time spent preparing developer guides.

For each of the 10 guides, I need to:
* research content ideas
* write Rust code
* write documentation
* record a YouTube video
