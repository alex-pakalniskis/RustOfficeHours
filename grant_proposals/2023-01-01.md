**Detailed description of your proposal**

While there is a growing demand for Rust skills across web3 and many core developer teams working on The Graph, the pool of skilled Rust engineers remains fairly small. 
Furthermore, there are few (if any) existing Rust learning materials with content specific to The Graph or web3.
This project aims to support the development of web3-focused Rust engineers by creating free and open source learning content about concepts relevant to The Graph.

Past and upcoming guide topics include:
* [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)
* [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/)
* [Graphcast](https://docs.graphops.xyz/graphcast/intro)
* and more

Please visit https://alex-pakalniskis.github.io/RustOfficeHoursResources/sessions.html to see a few prototype guides under development. 

**Goals & milestones**

10 Rust developer guides of increasing technical difficulty released over Q1 and Q2 2023.
Each guide will include a reference GitHub repository of completed Rust code, in-depth written instructions and explanations of Rust and The Graph concepts covered within, and an associated video recording shared on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@alexpakalniskis).

**Projected impact on The Graph**

Guides will support the learning of current and aspiring Rust engineers in our community by covering foundational-thru-intermediate Rust concepts while engaging with domain specific topics relevant to The Graph. Growing the pool of Rust engineers in the community will benefit the long-term health of the protocol by supporting the progressive decentralization of core tech stack contributions. Furthermore, this initative supports the on-going labor needs of core ecosystem developers by helping to train the next generation of web3-focused Rust engineers. 

**Proposed USD funding amount**

$5000

**Detailed description of the how the funds will be spent**

Compensation for time spent preparing developer guides.

For each of the 10 guides, I need to:
* research Rust and The Graph content ideas
* write Rust code
* write documentation
* record a YouTube video
