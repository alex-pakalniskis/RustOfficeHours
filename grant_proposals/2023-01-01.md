**Detailed description of your proposal**

While there is a growing demand for Rust skills across many core developer teams, the pool of skilled Rust engineers remains fairly small. 
Likewise, there are few (if any) existing Rust learning materials that are specific to The Graph.
This project aims to support the development of Rust engineers interested in The Graph protocol by creating content centered on The Graph.

Past and upcoming guide topics include:
* Subgraphs
* Substreams
* GraphCast

**Goals & milestones**

25 Rust developer guides of increasing difficulty released over 2023.
Each guide will also have an associated video recording shared on YouTube.

**Projected impact on The Graph**

Guides will support the learning of current and aspiring Rust engineers in our community by covering foundational and intermediate Rust concepts all while engaging with domain specific topics relevant to The Graph.

**Proposed USD funding amount**

$10000

**Detailed description of the how the funds will be spent**

Compensation for time spent preparing developer guides.

For each of the 25 guides, I need to:
* research content ideas
* write Rust code
* write documentation
* record a YouTube video
