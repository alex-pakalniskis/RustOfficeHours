Build a CLI tool to query a subgraph

## This week's query
Gnosis subgraphs on mainnet

``` gql
query GnosisSubgraphs {
  subgraphDeployments(where: {network: "gnosis"}) {
    id
    activeSubgraphCount
    createdAt
    ipfsHash
    subgraphCount
    stakedTokens
    signalledTokens
    originalName
  }
}
```

## Let's jump into some code
Coming soon
