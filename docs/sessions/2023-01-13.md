# Deserialize subgraph manifest YAML

*ROH: 2023-01-13*

#### Introduction

<br>

> The subgraph manifest `subgraph.yaml` defines the smart contracts your subgraph indexes, which events from these contracts to pay attention to, and how to map event data to entities that Graph Node stores and allows to query.

In this lesson we're building a program to deserialize a subgraph manifest stored on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System). To start, we'll use the [`graph-network-mainnet` subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/graph-network-mainnet) but later on we'll test on our with the [`Everest` subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/everest).
* `graph-network-mainnet` subgraph IPFS URL: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbW34MGRyp7LWkpDyKXDLWsKrN8iqZrNAMjGTYHN2zHa1
* `Everest` subgraph IPFS URL: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVsp1bC9rS3rf861cXgyvsqkpdsTXKSnS4729boXZvZyH

<br>

Manifest fields, subfields, and their types (in no particular order):
* `specVersion`: A Semver version indicating which version of this API is being used.
    * `String` type
* `repository`: An optional link to where the subgraph lives.
    * `String` type
* `description`: An optional description of the subgraph's purpose
    * `String` type
* `schema`: The GraphQL schema of this subgraph.
    * [`Schema`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#14-schema) type
* `dataSources`: Each data source spec defines the data that will be ingested as well as the transformation logic to derive the state of the subgraph's entities based on the source data.
    * [`Data Source Spec`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#17-data-source-templates)


<br>

`schema` fields and their types:
* `file`: The path of the GraphQL IDL file, either local or on IPFS.
    * [`Path`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#16-path) type


<br>

`dataSource` fields and their types
* `kind`: The type of data source. Possible values: ethereum/contract.
    * `String` type
* `name`: The name of the source data. Will be used to generate APIs in the mapping and also for self-documentation purposes.
    * `String` type
* `network`: For blockchains, this describes which network the subgraph targets. For Ethereum, this can be any of "mainnet", "rinkeby", "kovan", "ropsten", "goerli", "poa-core", "poa-sokol", "xdai", "matic", "mumbai", "fantom", "bsc" or "clover". Developers could look for an up to date list in the graph-cli code.
    * `String` type
* `source`: The source data on a blockchain such as Ethereum.
    * [`EthereumContractSource`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#151-ethereumcontractsource) type
* `mapping`: The transformation logic applied to the data prior to being indexed.
    * [`Mapping`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#152-mapping) type

<br>
<br>

Along with previously covered Rust concepts (see other guides), here’s a quick overview of the topics we’ll encouter in this lesson
* define custom `structs` that represent the generic properties of a subgraph manifest
* leverage [`serde_yaml`](https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/latest/serde_yaml/) crate and [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) crate's `derive` macro to deserialize the subgraph manifest `YAML` into custom `structs`.
* validate a program with a basic [test](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.3/tokio/attr.test.html)

<br>

Let's get started!

<br>

#### Code

<br>

From your terminal/command line, create a new `cargo` project and open it with VSCode
* If you don't already have Rust and `cargo` installed, here's the [official installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to help you get up and running. 
* This tutorial assumes you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor (VSCode).


``` bash
cargo new parse_subgraph_manifest
cd parse_subgraph_manifest
code .
```
<br>
<br>

With VSCode now open, update Cargo.toml with the following dependencies (add this below [dependencies]) then save your changes

``` toml
reqwest = { version = "0.11.13", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1.23.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.152",  features = ["derive"]}
serde_yaml = "0.9.16"
```

<br>

* [`reqwest`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) "provides a convenient, higher-level HTTP Client"
* [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) is an "event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language"
* [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) is a "framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically"
* [`serde_yaml`](https://docs.rs/serde_yaml/latest/serde_yaml/) is a library for using the Serde serialization framework with data in YAML file format.


<br>
<br>

Create a new file called src/utils.rs and add these `use` statements

``` rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::string::String;
use serde::Deserialize;
```

<br>

* [`std::collections::HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) - A hash map implemented with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup.
* [`std::string::String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) - A UTF-8–encoded, growable string.
* [`serde::Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Deserialize.html) - A data structure that can be deserialized from any data format supported by Serde.

<br>
<br>

Next, add some `struct` statments to the same file the save

``` rust
#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct SubgraphManifest {
    pub dataSources: Vec<DataSource>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub repository: Option<String>,
    pub specVersion: String,
    pub schema: SchemaAddress,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct SchemaAddress {
    pub file: HashMap<String, String>,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct DataSource {
    pub kind: String,
    pub mapping: Mapping,
    pub name: String,
    pub network: String,
    pub source: Source,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct Mapping {
    pub abis: serde_yaml::Sequence,
    pub apiVersion: String,
    pub entities: serde_yaml::Sequence,
    pub eventHandlers: serde_yaml::Sequence,
    pub file: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub kind: String,
    pub language: String,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct Source {
    pub abi: String,
    pub address: String,
    pub startBlock: u32,
}
```
<br>

Structs
* `SubgraphManifest` - maps to a subgraph manifest and some of it's fields
* `SchemaAddress` - `maps to a manifest's schema address on IPFS
* `DataSource` - maps to a single entry in a manifest's `dataSources`
* `Mapping` - maps to `mapping` field of a `dataSource` entry
* `Source` - maps to `source` field of a `dataSource` entry

<br>

See [Subgraph Manifest docs](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md) for full specification details. 

<br>
<br>

Navigate to src/main.rs and add the following `use` and `mod` statements

``` rust
use std::error::Error;

mod utils;
use crate::utils::SubgraphManifest;
```

<br>

* [`use std::error::Error`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html) - a trait representing the basic expectations for error values, i.e., values of type `E` in `Result<T, E>`.
* `mod utils` - will look for a file named `utils.rs` and will insert its contents inside a module named `utils` under this scope
* `use crate::utils::SubgraphManifest` - will bind full `crate::utils::SubgraphManifest` path to `SubgraphManifest` for easier access

<br>
<br>

Now add a `main` function with the following content

``` rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {

    let manifest_response = reqwest::get("https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbW34MGRyp7LWkpDyKXDLWsKrN8iqZrNAMjGTYHN2zHa1")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await?;

    let manifest_data: SubgraphManifest = serde_yaml::from_str(&manifest_response).unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", manifest_data);

    Ok(())
}
```

<br>

Some notes:
* our `main` function is `async`, powered by [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/)
    * doesn't return a value so we use the [`unit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.unit.html) type in our result
        * also note the `unit` type in `Ok(())`
    * [Boxing errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/boxing_errors.html) from our result with `Box<dyn Error>`
* we perform a `GET` request to `IPFS` then store response text in `manifest_response` variable
* we leverage `serde_yaml` to deserialize a reference to `manifest_response` into a variable `manifest_data` of type `SubgraphManifest`
* finally we print out `manifest_data` to our terminal

<br>
<br>

Save your changes then run the program from the integrated terminal in VSCode

``` bash
cargo run
```

<br>
<br>


To wrap things up let's add a test below the `main` function. 

Check out [Chapter 11 of The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html) for a more thorough discussion of tests in Rust. We're leveraging [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.3/tokio/attr.test.html) again to help with our `async` testing.


``` rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn deserialize_everest_subgraph_manifest_repo()-> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let manifest_response = reqwest::get("https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVsp1bC9rS3rf861cXgyvsqkpdsTXKSnS4729boXZvZyH")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await?;

    let manifest_data: SubgraphManifest = serde_yaml::from_str(&manifest_response).unwrap();

    let subgraph_manifest_repository = "https://github.com/graphprotocol/everest";

    assert_eq!(manifest_data.repository, subgraph_manifest_repository);

    Ok(())
}
```

<br>

Instead of printing results to our terminal, we use [`assert_eq` macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html) to compare the deserialized manifest repository URL with a hard-coded value we provide. Additionally we are testing against the `Everest` subgraph in this function. 

<br>
<br>


Go ahead and run your test.

``` bash
cargo test
```
