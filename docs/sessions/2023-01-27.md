# Parse subgraph schema data

*2023-01-27*

#### Introduction

<br>

> With The Graph, you simply define entity types in schema.graphql, and Graph Node will generate top level fields for querying single instances and collections of that entity type. 
> 
> -[The Graph docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#the-graph-ql-schema)

<br>
<br>

In this lesson we're building a program to parse a subgraph schema. To simplify development we're going to store a `schema.graphql` file locally. Let's use the contents of the [Everest Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/graphprotocol/everest) schema to develop our program.

> A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax.

<br>

Let's get started!

#### Code

From your terminal/command line, create a new cargo project and open it with VSCode

<br>

``` bash
cargo new parse_subgraph_schema
cd parse_subgraph_schema
code .
```
<br>
<br>

With VSCode now open, update Cargo.toml with the following dependencies (add this below `[dependencies]`) then save your changes

<br>

``` toml
tokio = { version = "1.23.0", features = ["full"] }
graphql-parser = "0.4.0"
```


<br>
<br>

Create a file called `schema.graphql`, paste the contents of today's data into it, then save

<br>
<br>

Open src/main.rs and add these `use` statements

<br>

``` rust
use std::string::String;
use std::error::Error;

use graphql_parser::schema::parse_schema;
use graphql_parser::schema::Definition::{SchemaDefinition, TypeDefinition, TypeExtension, DirectiveDefinition};
use graphql_parser::schema::TypeDefinition::{Scalar, Object, Interface, Union, Enum, InputObject};
use graphql_parser::query::Type;
```

<br>
<br>

Next add these `struct` statements to main.rs

<br>

``` rust
#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DefintionResult<'a> {
    name: String,
    description: Option<String>,
    fields: Vec<DefinitionField<'a>>,
    values: Vec<DefinitionValue>,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DefinitionField<'a> {
    name: String,
    description: Option<String>,
    field_type: Type<'a, String>,
}

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DefinitionValue {
    name: String,
    description: Option<String>,
}
```

<br>

> The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which cause a program to reference data other than the data it’s intended to reference. 
> 
> -[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html)

<br>
<br>

Replace the main function body with this 

<br>

``` rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Read schema.graphql
    let contents = std::fs::read_to_string("schema.graphql")
    .expect("Should have been able to read the file");
    
    // Parse schema
    let ast = parse_schema::<String>(&contents)?.to_owned();

    // Traverse type definition options with match
    let mut results: Vec<DefintionResult> = Vec::new();
    
    for definition in ast.definitions {
        match definition {
            TypeDefinition(Object(o)) => {
                let mut tmp_fields: Vec<DefinitionField> = Vec::new();
                for field in o.fields {
                    tmp_fields.push(
                        DefinitionField {
                            name: field.name,
                            description: field.description,
                            field_type: field.field_type,
                        }
                    );
                }
                let mut tmp_values: Vec<DefinitionValue> = Vec::new();
                tmp_values.push(
                    DefinitionValue {
                        name: "None".to_string(),
                        description: None,
                    }
                );
                results.push(
                    DefintionResult {
                        name: o.name,
                        description: o.description,
                        fields: tmp_fields,
                        values: tmp_values,
                    }
                );
            },
            TypeDefinition(Enum(e)) => {
                let mut tmp_values: Vec<DefinitionValue> = Vec::new();
                for value in e.values {
                    tmp_values.push(
                        DefinitionValue {
                            name: value.name,
                            description: value.description,
                        }
                    );
                }
                let mut tmp_fields: Vec<DefinitionField> = Vec::new();
                tmp_fields.push(
                    DefinitionField {
                        name: "None".to_string(),
                        description: None,
                        field_type: Type::NamedType("None".to_string()),
                    }
                );
                results.push(
                    DefintionResult {
                        name: e.name,
                        description: e.description,
                        fields: tmp_fields,
                        values: tmp_values,
                    }
                );
            },
            TypeDefinition(Scalar(s)) => {
                println!("Coming soon");
            },
            TypeDefinition(Interface(i)) => {
                println!("Coming soon");
            },
            TypeDefinition(Union(u)) => {
                println!("Coming soon");
            },
            TypeDefinition(InputObject(io)) => {
                println!("Coming soon");
            },
            SchemaDefinition(_) | TypeExtension(_) | DirectiveDefinition(_) => todo!(),
        }
    }

    // Print results
    for res in results {
        println!("{:?}", res);
        println!("");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

<br>

That's a lot to unpack. Let's go section by section. 

<br>

##### Read schema.graphql
Uses the [`std::fs`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/) module to read the contents of a file to a [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html).
* See [`std::fs::read_to_string`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.read_to_string.html) docs for more

##### Parse schema
Uses the [`graphql_parser`](https://docs.rs/graphql-parser/latest/graphql_parser/index.html) library to parse `String` of file contents. 
* See [`graphql_parser::parse_schema`](https://docs.rs/graphql-parser/latest/graphql_parser/fn.parse_schema.html) docs for more

##### Traverse type definition options with match
Uses our custom `structs` and loops through schema AST definitions to populate `results`. Matches AST definitions based on TypeDefinition, populating `results` accordingly.
* Some `match` branches only output a `Coming soon` message, so finish defining the branches as an extra learning challenge. 

##### Print results
Uses `println` macro to output our results.

<br>
<br>

Save your changes then run the program from the integrated terminal in VSCode

<br>

``` bash
cargo run
```
